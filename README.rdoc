=Introvert

A module to easily trace and profile programs.

The main purpose of this module is to allow me to trace method calls
throughout the execution of a program to analyze a program's runtime
behavior.

==Quick Example

  require 'introvert'
  Introvert.trace(:call_tree) do
    # ... some code of interest
  end
  => prints lots of interesting things

==Installation

  gem build introvert.gemspec
  gem install introvert-0.0.1.gem
